# Ultimate_TicTacToe_Bot
This program includes simulator.py which is the platform for the running of the 2 bots fighting against each other.
Team42 is the Bot that I created and test is the bot that an another player created. 
When the simulator.py is run with an argument value of 2, then the scores are outputted.
